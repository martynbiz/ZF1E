The Zend Framework 1 Extension library

This library provides extensions to common programming practices I use through
my ZF1 projects. It is easy to incorporate this library into your existing ZF1
project. Just register the ZFE namespace by adding the following line to your
application configuration:

autoloadernamespaces.zfe = "ZFE"

Then put a symlink called ZFE in your library/ directory, pointing to the
library/ directory in the ZF1E directory.
